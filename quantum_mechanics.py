""" monte_carlo module

This module contains all functions related to computing a quantum mechanical wavefunction
by imaginary time propagation (monte carlo integral approximation)
Import this module as follows:
    import quantum_mechanics as qm

"""
there should probably be some standard for how we represent the electron and nucleus parameters
probably a shared object/simplenamespace/dictionary/enum kind of thing between the QM and FNN modules?
"""


""" Do we need to things such as the Kinetic and Potential of the Hamiltonian? """


""" This will probably be used by/interact with `monte_carlo.py` and `fermi_neural_net.py` """
