# FermiNet: PHYS 449 Final Project
This projects goal is to replicate the algorithm and experiments defined in 
"Ab-Initio Solution of the Many-Electron Schroedinger Equation with Deep Neural Networks", David Pfau, James S. Spencer, Alex G de G Matthews and W.M.C. Foulkes, Phys. Rev. Research 2, 033429 (2020).
\
The FermiNet is used as a replacement for the trail wavefunction that is feed 
into a montie carlo to find the ground state energy of the system.
